# KidKlub!

Check the app at [www.kidklub.org](https://kidklub.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Brief

A MERN Stack complex web application which can be used as a student portal and activity hub by any elementary & middle school

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
